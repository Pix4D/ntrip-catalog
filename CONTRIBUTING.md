# Contributing

## Who can contribute?
Anybody is welcome to contribute to this catalog, but ideally we expect NTRIP providers to submit their data themselves.
If you find the proper documentation published by the NTRIP provider confirming the CRS used, and do not expect the provider to do it, you can contribute it as well.
Notice that any contribution should be properly documented, filling the `reference` section in the json file.

## How to contribute
Just create a PR in this GitHub project.
In case you do not know how to do it, or you do not feel comfortable with JSON, you can open an Issue providing all the data.
All contributions must be properly documented, filling the `reference` section in the JSON file.
This database is intended to become a trusted source of information,
therefore submissions that cannot be backed by an authoritative reference will not be considered.
Any new entry should be added to the appropriate country/region-specific file below the `data` folder. Existing entries in this folder can be used as an example and starting point.

All contributions to NTRIP-catalog are subject to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO, https://developercertificate.org/).

All contributions must be signed off in the form of a `Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>` line at the end of each commit message, using the contributor's real name and email address.
By signing off, the contributor agrees to the DCO.
The line will be added automatically when using the `git commit -s` command.

## How to report errors
In case you find any error you can either make a Pull Request or write an email to `ntrip-catalog (at) ntrip-catalog.org`
